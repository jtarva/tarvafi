## The Challenge

Finland's pharmaceutical registry system (iRis) was facing critical challenges:

- **An aging system** struggling with modern regulatory requirements.
- **Manual, Excel-based processes** creating inefficiencies across the organization.
- **Need to comply** with upcoming EU regulations for automated pharmaceutical change management.
- **Disconnected data silos** preventing efficient information flow between stakeholders.

## My Role

As Senior Product Designer in a cross-functional team at Solita, I co-led the design effort alongside a colleague to reimagine how Finland manages pharmaceutical data. Our team included developers, IT architects, process specialists, and end-user specialists from both Solita and Fimea.

## Design Approach

### Understanding the Ecosystem

My fellow designer and I began by conducting extensive stakeholder mapping across Fimea's organization, facilitating workshops with administrative staff, system administrators, researchers, and doctors. We created detailed journey maps that revealed how existing Excel-driven processes were creating bottlenecks and inefficiencies, while analyzing Finland's regulatory landscape and EU compliance requirements that would impact user workflows.

### Data Transformation and Trust Building

While our development team operated using agile methodologies, the real challenge was working with Fimea to bridge the gap between their existing system and future needs. We spent significant time helping stakeholders understand the difference between the original system's data points and what would be needed for the new system, scoping the project based on must-have data requirements. Equally important was building trust among the entire team: creating an environment where both Solita and Fimea members felt comfortable sharing concerns and feedback openly.

### Rapid Iteration Through Design Sprints

We translated identified use cases into detailed user interface sketches while developers set up the required infrastructure. Once two-week sprints started, we established a good rhythm with Fimea to validate designs before building them. We remained flexible, breaking from the sprint rhythm when needed to conduct spikes on difficult problems. Our design documentation lived in Figma, while development coordination was maintained through JIRA and Confluence.

## Key Design Deliverables

### Information Architecture Transformation

- Our team redesigned the data structure to support both current needs and future scalability
- Created a unified system replacing fragmented Excel-based workflows
- Designed intuitive navigation for multiple user types (regulators, pharmaceutical companies, administrators)

### User Interface Design

- We developed a modern, user-friendly interface with responsive designs
- Created responsive designs for various device types
- Designed specialized views for different user roles while maintaining consistency

### Process Visualization

- Illustrated complex pharmaceutical approval workflows in clear, actionable interfaces
- Designed dashboard views for tracking applications and regulatory changes
- Created notification systems for critical updates and deadlines

## Implementation & Testing

### Early and Continuous Testing

- No dedicated testing team initially - developers conducted early testing
- Facilitated weekly testing sessions with 2-6 participants from the development team
- Designed testing protocols for E2E validation
- Created feedback loops to quickly incorporate user insights

### Deployment Strategy

- Designed the rollout plan for Saga system implementation across Fimea
- Created training materials and onboarding flows for different user groups
- Developed change management materials to ease the transition

## Results & Impact

### Immediate Outcomes

- **Successfully launched** the first production version ahead of deadline.
- **Reduced manual processing time** 2-15x depending on the task through automation.
- **Improved data quality** and consistency across the organization.

### Continued Collaboration

The cooperation between Solita and Fimea has successfully continued to this day, with the platform functionalities expanding significantly. The system has gained praise and interest among other European medicinal agencies, demonstrating the success of the collaborative approach and the platform's potential for broader impact across the pharmaceutical regulatory landscape.

## Design Lessons Learned

### 1. Co-creation is Critical
Working closely with my design colleague allowed us to tackle complex problems from multiple angles and maintain design consistency across a large system.

### 2. Facilitation as a Design Tool
A well-facilitated kickoff was crucial for project success. We brought together diverse stakeholders early to align on goals and establish shared working methods.

### 3. Bridging Technical and Human Needs
The project required balancing strict regulatory requirements with user-friendly interfaces. We achieved this through iterative testing and continuous stakeholder engagement.

### 4. Designing for Change
Beyond creating interfaces, we designed new ways of working that transformed how Fimea operates, moving from siloed departments to integrated teams.
