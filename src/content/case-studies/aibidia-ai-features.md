## The Challenge

Aibidia's enterprise clients were struggling with manual document translation processes in their transfer pricing workflows. The challenge was translating thousands of regulatory documents across 15+ languages while maintaining legal accuracy and audit compliance.

- **Manual translation bottlenecks** were slowing compliance processes, taking 2-3 days per document for multinational corporations.
- **Language barriers** created inefficiencies in global tax documentation workflows across 15+ languages.
- **Quality inconsistencies** in translations were impacting compliance accuracy, particularly for specialized tax and legal terminology.
- **High operational costs** from outsourced translation services.

## My Role

As Co-Head of Compliance Product, I co-owned the end-to-end strategy and execution of AI-powered compliance features. I collaborated directly with data scientists to define the technical approach: combining third-party AI translation services with custom fine-tuning for high-priority languages on tax and legal terminology. I designed the product experience and detailed UX to set clear expectationsâ€”users understood translation quality levels and the workflow enabled easy manual review and correction. This transparency built trust and drove adoption. I defined success metrics and managed the cross-functional launch with engineering and customer success teams.

## Design Approach

### 1. Market Research and User Validation

- Conducted user interviews with enterprise clients to understand translation pain points
- Analyzed existing workflows and identified automation opportunities
- Researched AI/ML capabilities and competitive landscape in tax technology
- Validated business case with senior leadership and key enterprise accounts

### 2. AI Experience Design

- Designed user flows for AI-assisted document translation with single-click translation generation and storage
- Created interfaces that balanced automation with user control and transparency, setting clear expectations about translation quality levels
- Developed confidence indicators and quality assurance workflows that enabled easy manual review and correction
- Established fallback patterns for edge cases and quality issues, particularly for languages without custom fine-tuning

### 3. Enterprise Integration Strategy

- Mapped AI features to existing enterprise workflows and compliance requirements
- Together with Customer Success created documentation and training materials for client teams
- Established metrics for measuring AI feature adoption and business impact

## Implementation & Results

### Technical Innovation
- **Hybrid AI approach** combining third-party AI translation services with custom fine-tuning for high-priority languages
- **Enterprise-grade reliability** meeting compliance and security requirements for regulatory documents
- **Scalable processing** capable of handling thousands of documents across 15+ languages

### Business Impact
- **Drove expansion revenue** from existing enterprise accounts through AI feature adoption
- **Strong product-led growth** with customers enabling the premium feature based on product value alone
- **Market differentiation** validating AI product capabilities and opening conversations with prospects about additional AI-powered compliance automation

### Efficiency and Quality Outcomes
- **95%+ accuracy** on regulatory terminology for custom fine-tuned languages
- **Reduced translation time** from 2-3 days (manual) to 2-3 hours (AI-assisted)
- **Streamlined workflow** enabling translation generation and storage with a single click
- **Positive customer satisfaction** with time savings, despite need for manual review on some languages
- **High adoption rate** driven by thoughtful UX that built trust through transparency about quality levels

## Design Lessons Learned

### 1. AI Needs Human-Centered Design
Even advanced AI capabilities require thoughtful UX design to build user trust, provide transparency, and handle edge cases gracefully.

### 2. Enterprise AI Adoption is Different
Large multinational clients need extensive validation, training, and change management support when adopting AI-powered features.

### 3. Strategic Feature Design Drives Revenue
Carefully designed AI capabilities that solve real enterprise pain points can create new revenue streams and increase account value.

### 4. Cross-functional Collaboration is Essential
Successfully launching AI features required close collaboration between product, engineering, data science, and client success teams throughout the entire development cycle.
